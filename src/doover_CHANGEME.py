#!/usr/bin/env python3

# If you're using python, this is a good place to start.
# Put ALL of your logic in this file. Don't import other files, it makes the export more difficult.
# If you REALLY need to import something, preferably install it, otherwise add it as another file to the .install file.

# Any packages you install MUST be installable via debian packages. Find the appropriate package and add it to the
# `debian/control` file. If you can't find a package and really want it, find someone who knows how to publish a
# supplementary package to our doover apt repository.

# Finally, make sure this file is executable (chmod +x filename.py) and it actually does something when you run it.
